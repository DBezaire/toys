Toys dev notes

ToDo
- get hihat to work on local


2021-07-20
As of end of first build with node and express:
- Class
  - worked well for sliders and buttons with many instances
  - also useful for metrotimer to add reporting elements
  
- AudioContext
  - amazing timing functions
  - used oscillator, noise buffer, samples
  ??? still get CORS error for sample from heroku
  
- heroku
  - easy to create dynos to run app
  - easy to use GIT to deploy to heroku
  - heroku app on PC manages most heroku functions without logging in there
  - run local copy: heroku local
  - shows ongoing logs: heroku logs --num=20 --dyno=web --tail
  - barfed on fixed port assignment: had to get from environment variable
  
- GIT
  - two repos now on GITHUB
  - typical process: 
    - git status
    - git add .
    - git commit -m "message"
    - git push heroku main
    - git push origin main
    
- Node.js
  - node app.js to run
  - nodemon to restart automatically after changes: nodemon app.js
  
- Node express
  - had to limit the "express.static" with a '/static' path to keep strange things from happening
  - had to calculate port from environment variable so it will work on heroku which barfs on fixed assignment
  - really forced use of a template engine so used 'sprightly' which is very light weight
  - auto configurator built a structure that was somewhat overkill; 
    - replaced ./bin/www with call to app.listen in app.js
  - separate path.js can be disbanded by (a) not used anywhere so put into app.js; or (b) get app.js to export the paths
